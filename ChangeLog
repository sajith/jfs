	Fix build against libpthread.

	* configure.in: Look for pthread_exit in libpthread instead of
	cthread_init in libthreads.
	* Makefile.am: Link against libpthread instead of libthreads.
	* dir.c: Use pthread_mutex_lock/unlock instead of mutex_lock/unlock.
	(read_node) Use posix-compliant st_atime struct members.
	* jfs.c: Include pthread.h instead of cthreads.h.
	(main): Use pthread_exit instead of cthread_exit.
	(jfs_info, jfs_panic): Use pthread_mutex_lock/unlock instead of
	mutex_lock/unlock.

	* Initial release. All it does is reading from JFS partitions, on
	my computer at least. A whole lot of things are missing...
