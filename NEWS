The Clueless Programmers' JFS Translator
----------------------------------------

At last this translator is out of deep freeze.

This translator could read JFS partitions (at least on the computers
we tried it on) by 2002 August, but then our final semester exams
started and, after the exams, we moved to our homes. Neither John nor
me didn't have much of an internet connection to put this thing
somewhere on the web.  We couldn't keep track of the mailing lists
either.  (I swear this is true.  We're poor jobless Indian youth.)
Finally I bought a modem... and here's it - "the first (and only, as
of now) industrial strength journaling filesystem for the Hurd"
Only, it doesn't do journaling, let alone writing :)
