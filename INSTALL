Compiling and installing the translator
---------------------------------------

This works for me:

$ make -f Makefile.sep
$ su -c "cp jfs /hurd"

It probably wouldn't compile correctly on recent releases of the Hurd.
Mine is a pre-libio Hurd-0.2, installed from quite old Debian G1 CDs.
Apparently many things have changed since then. I don't have access to
a recent release of the Hurd, so I don't know what works. Please fix
errors yourself if you can.

The translator is invoked like this (assuming /dev/hd0s5 is a JFS
partition):

$ settrans -ac node /hurd/jfs /dev/hd0s5

It can't do passive translation yet. 

See "invoking settrans" in the GNU Hurd Reference Manual for details.

Further, there are 'Makefile.am' and 'configure.in' files which can be
processed by GNU autotools. I used them basically to learn autotools
and for convenience. They should work, but aren't good enough...
