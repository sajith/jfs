The Clueless Programmers' JFS Translator
----------------------------------------

* Compile and run on a recent Hurd system.

* Fix permissions problem.

* It doesn't do passive translation.

* On running 'find', it breaks. Fix.

* Check cleanliness on invoking the translator.

* callbacks.c screams for attention.

* Port jfsutils package to Hurd.

* Fix inconsistency in the use of datatypes. We've unsigned int at
  someplace, u32 at another place, uint32_t at someplace else...

* Reading and 'riting : Make the translator write-capable.
  Probably beyond me.
